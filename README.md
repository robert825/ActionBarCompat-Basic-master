Android ActionBarCompat-Basic Sample
===================================

This in class activity is based on one of the Google offical code samples found
at https://github.com/googlesamples/android-ActionBarCompat-Basic.

Introduction
------------

The goal of this activity is to add some basic menu bar funcitonality to the sample
code.  You may need to install some additional Android components to get the system 
to build.

Pre-requisites
--------------

- Android SDK 25
- Android Build Tools v25.0.2
- Android Support Repository

Getting Started
---------------

After you clone the repository, open the project.  If you get any build errors, you 
may need to follow the prompts in the errors to install the missing libraries.

Once the project builds, look through the code to become familiar with it.  In 
particular, look at the menu xml file to see how that works.

You are going to add functionality to the three menu buttons.

- The first menu button should alternate starting and stopping the service included in the project.  
- The second menu button should open a URL entered into the EditText on screen in the default web browser.
- The third menu button should open a new Activity that you create.

For all of these, feel free to add fields/methods as you see fit to accomplish the tasks.

The first two tasks are relatively simple, while the third is much more open-ended and
requires you to create more files.  

After you successfully complete the first two tasks, create a new Activity screen that will be launched
by the third button that will:

- Allow a user to set a username, first name, and last name;
- When you return to the original Activity, display this information in a SnackBar.

When you are finished with this activity, zip up your project and submit it along with an .apk to the assignment
in Collab.
